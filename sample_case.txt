In January 2023, Creative Industries invited several software companies to bid for the job of producing software to do something. SoftCo made a presentation at its own expense, which incorporated some demos of softwares that SoftCo had produced for other clients and ideas it had in mind for Creative Industries. In February 2023, SoftCo sent Creative Industries a presentation and cost estimates for a software. The total estimate for creating the software was $6000. In March 2023, after reviewing SoftCo’s presentation and those submitted by other bidders, the president of Creative Industries called the president of SoftCo and told her that SoftCo had the job. Creative Industries wanted SoftCo to design the software. In April 2023, Creative Industries received SoftCo’s pre-printed form contract providing as follows: “Order is to be entered in accordance with prices, delivery and specifications shown below.” The description of what was ordered was handwritten as follows: “[…]”The CEO of Creative Industries signed the contract and returned a copy of the agreement to SoftCo. At the end of May 2023, the CEO of Creative Industries received a first demo but did not like what he saw. He immediately telephoned the president of SoftCo, declaring that he wanted SoftCo to modify the demo and that, otherwise, he would cancel the contract due to lack of satisfaction with the proposed demo. SoftCo refused to comply with Creative Industries’s request to modifiy the demo. Instead, SoftCo proceeded to finish production of the software. Upon completion, SoftCo sent a bill for $8000 to Creative Industries.
