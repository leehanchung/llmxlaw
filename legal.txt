	B. Element 2: Plaintiff was harmed

3. Breach of contract ("cause of action for damages for breach of contract is comprised of the following elements: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to plaintiff.")

  [Loop for each defendant described]

6. Factual Background

  [LLM numbered paragraph for each material fact]

7. Claims (1...n)

  [Loop for each claim]
